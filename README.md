display: flex allows you to control alignment and layment of a container

What is a media query?
A media query is a way to apply styles in CSS under certain conditions. 

Why should responsive design be handled in CSS, not JavaScript?
CSS is faster as it is interepreted by the browser and JavaScript runs after the page loads. CSS is more responsive and allows for cleaner code.  

What happens if media query is placed before base styles?
CSS rules are applied in order, so the base style would overrule the media query if it came first.
